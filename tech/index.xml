      <title>Caching pip packages using devpi &amp; docker</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re using python packages &amp;amp; virtualenvs a lot, you can drastically speed up the time to setup your environment, (which mostly involves download of pip packages, which tend to be network intensive &amp;amp; time consuming) by caching pip packages. Similar to other caching proxies like apt, python has its own caching proxy in the form of devpi, which allows you to run a pypi mirror in your laptop. (devpi is much more than just a pip mirror, for more on its capabilities read the link)</description>

      <title>Collecting distributed system links</title>

      <description>Of late I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to learn a lot about distributed systems. Also started a github project awesome distributed systems, which hopefully will grow over time to collect links for readings in this domain. If you know of any links please consider adding to the project.</description>

      <title>The very basics of service discovery</title>
      <link>http://includeio.stream/tech/service-discovery/</link>

      <description>This is meant to be an introductory post to a series of posts about Service Discovery and Distributed Consensus. Hopefully this will be series of posts on more aspects of service discovery &amp;amp; Consul etc.
Service Discovery We begin with the simple problem of identifying which host/port services are running. For eg. in a small webapp, a simple static conf file could point to the DB node. As functionality grows you would have various (preferably stateless) services talking on different ports (and even different servers).</description>

      <description>Moved my blog from pelican to Hugo. Though there was nothing wrong with pelican as such, mostly I found a problem with my blog/theme not as update with pelican upstream. Hugo is a static site generator written by Steve Francia (@spf13). It is written in Go &amp;amp; amazingly fast to generate a site. Developing sites with hugo is kind of fun; running hugo in watch mode, you get to see the site as you write.</description>

      <title>Running Go ci tests in a docker</title>
      <link>http://includeio.stream/tech/go-docker-ci/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with the idea of using containers for running ci tests, primarily to have a quicker feedback loop; instead of setups that involve VMs etc. They are ideal for getting an environment up and running quickly and cheap to throw away too.
A project which I&amp;rsquo;m spending some time lately go-ceph, which provides Go bindings for ceph/rados, kind of ideally fit the bill for using this, since testing this project locally, usually needed something like a VM running a ceph cluster, or a locally running ceph.</description>

      <title>Faster python builds in Travis with container based infra</title>
      <link>http://includeio.stream/tech/travis-builds/</link>

      <description>Lately, travis CI has started supporting builds using container based infrastructure which run much faster due to more available resources and good use of caching. This is currently possible only for projects that don&amp;rsquo;t use sudo atm . For more details read this post. Of late, I have been submitting Pull Requests to various projects to use this feature wherever possible. This post is primarily oriented towards Python projects.
For many python projects, a significant amount of time is spent in installing &amp;amp; building the dependencies.</description>

      <title>2014: the year in books, using Goodreads, pandas &amp; Hy</title>
      <link>http://includeio.stream/tech/goodreads/</link>

      <guid>http://includeio.stream/tech/goodreads/</guid>
      <description>Note: The content has been updated to reflect the new kwargs style in Hy, as such the snippets only work with the current Hy master
As 2014 is coming to a close, I thought it would be a nice time to review the year as far as reading was concerned. Since I track the books I read using Goodreads, I felt it would be an interesting experiment to see some numbers from Goodreads.</description>

      <title>The Silent Observer&#39;s Metamorphosis</title>

      <description>My friend, Jinto, wrote a blog-post titled Transitioning from learners to observers, which talks about the increasing transition from a learner to being a casual observer of things in this digital era. The availability of a wide range of tools these days to do almost anything, has slowly reduced the need to learn, a very valid observation.
While the usefulness of tools is great, it might fail miserably when you want things certain way, and the tool may not be designed for that.</description>

      <description>This post lists the details of my blog, which is powered by gh-pages and pelican. In short another guy puts up his blog at GitHub and blogs about it. It initially started as a Lorem Ipsum content while I was testing out my rough and edgy pelican theme. You have been warned!
Welcome to the new avatar of my blog which is powered by pelican, just another static site generator.</description>
