      <description>It has been a significant time between the posts. This time the reason moslty being me lazy enough not to fix the blog after a pelican update. Surpisingly though there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a change required other than tweaking a couple of configuration variables &amp;amp; renaming the pelicanconf file. Hope to start blogging again soon. This time for real and hopefully more tech posts. C ya :)</description>
