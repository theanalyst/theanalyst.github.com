      <description>This is the quintessential “I&amp;rsquo;m back” post in blogosphere, which is often marked by a blogger coming up with imaginative reasons to explain a questionable absence from the virtual world. Tempting explanations for, not writing for so long, include work pressure, often marked by people blaming work for (not) following their interests, a generic term, which, writers &amp;amp; artists lovingly call the writer’s block, to describe their shortage of creativity. Of course, if you know me, you know the actual reason is just a cover up for not mentioning my often recurring theme of procrastination.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re reading this, it means that I have successfully started blogging again. As the more perceptive of you might have realized, this blog isn&amp;rsquo;t hosted at blogger anymore well this new avatar is powered by pelican, an awesome static blogging engine written in python and served by github pages, (of course the second part should be intuitionally obvious, given the url atm).
While the sabbatical from blogosphere has been long, it was more because of lack of anything to post rather than too busy to post anything, and now I&amp;rsquo;m back from a questionably long self-imposed exile.</description>
