      <description>My friend, Jinto, wrote a blog-post titled Transitioning from learners to observers, which talks about the increasing transition from a learner to being a casual observer of things in this digital era. The availability of a wide range of tools these days to do almost anything, has slowly reduced the need to learn, a very valid observation.
While the usefulness of tools is great, it might fail miserably when you want things certain way, and the tool may not be designed for that.</description>
