      <description>Lately, travis CI has started supporting builds using container based infrastructure which run much faster due to more available resources and good use of caching. This is currently possible only for projects that don&amp;rsquo;t use sudo atm . For more details read this post. Of late, I have been submitting Pull Requests to various projects to use this feature wherever possible. This post is primarily oriented towards Python projects.
For many python projects, a significant amount of time is spent in installing &amp;amp; building the dependencies.</description>
