      <description>Of late I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to learn a lot about distributed systems. Also started a github project awesome distributed systems, which hopefully will grow over time to collect links for readings in this domain. If you know of any links please consider adding to the project.</description>

      <description>This is meant to be an introductory post to a series of posts about Service Discovery and Distributed Consensus. Hopefully this will be series of posts on more aspects of service discovery &amp;amp; Consul etc.
Service Discovery We begin with the simple problem of identifying which host/port services are running. For eg. in a small webapp, a simple static conf file could point to the DB node. As functionality grows you would have various (preferably stateless) services talking on different ports (and even different servers).</description>
