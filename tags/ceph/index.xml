      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with the idea of using containers for running ci tests, primarily to have a quicker feedback loop; instead of setups that involve VMs etc. They are ideal for getting an environment up and running quickly and cheap to throw away too.
A project which I&amp;rsquo;m spending some time lately go-ceph, which provides Go bindings for ceph/rados, kind of ideally fit the bill for using this, since testing this project locally, usually needed something like a VM running a ceph cluster, or a locally running ceph.</description>
