      <title>Caching pip packages using devpi &amp; docker</title>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re using python packages &amp;amp; virtualenvs a lot, you can drastically speed up the time to setup your environment, (which mostly involves download of pip packages, which tend to be network intensive &amp;amp; time consuming) by caching pip packages. Similar to other caching proxies like apt, python has its own caching proxy in the form of devpi, which allows you to run a pypi mirror in your laptop. (devpi is much more than just a pip mirror, for more on its capabilities read the link)</description>

      <title>Running Go ci tests in a docker</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been toying around with the idea of using containers for running ci tests, primarily to have a quicker feedback loop; instead of setups that involve VMs etc. They are ideal for getting an environment up and running quickly and cheap to throw away too.
A project which I&amp;rsquo;m spending some time lately go-ceph, which provides Go bindings for ceph/rados, kind of ideally fit the bill for using this, since testing this project locally, usually needed something like a VM running a ceph cluster, or a locally running ceph.</description>
