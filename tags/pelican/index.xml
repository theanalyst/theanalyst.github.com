      <description>Moved my blog from pelican to Hugo. Though there was nothing wrong with pelican as such, mostly I found a problem with my blog/theme not as update with pelican upstream. Hugo is a static site generator written by Steve Francia (@spf13). It is written in Go &amp;amp; amazingly fast to generate a site. Developing sites with hugo is kind of fun; running hugo in watch mode, you get to see the site as you write.</description>

      <description>It has been a significant time between the posts. This time the reason moslty being me lazy enough not to fix the blog after a pelican update. Surpisingly though there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a change required other than tweaking a couple of configuration variables &amp;amp; renaming the pelicanconf file. Hope to start blogging again soon. This time for real and hopefully more tech posts. C ya :)</description>
