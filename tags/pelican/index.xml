      <description>&lt;p&gt;Moved my blog from pelican to &lt;a href=&#34;http://gohugo.io&#34;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;. Though there was nothing
wrong with pelican as such, mostly I found a problem with my
blog/theme not as update with pelican upstream. Hugo is a static site
generator written by Steve Francia (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spf13&#34;&gt;@spf13&lt;/a&gt;). It is written in Go
&amp;amp; amazingly fast to generate a site. Developing sites with hugo
is kind of fun; running hugo in watch mode, you get to see the site as
you write. Also hugo has a nice set of themes and rather simplistic
approach to organizing content. Hopefully the new avatar of the blog
should keep me interested in blogging for a while!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It has been a significant time between the posts. This time the reason
moslty being me lazy enough not to fix the blog after a pelican
update. Surpisingly though there wasn&amp;rsquo;t much of a change required
other than tweaking a couple of configuration variables &amp;amp; renaming the
&lt;code&gt;pelicanconf&lt;/code&gt; file. Hope to start blogging again soon. This time for
real and hopefully more tech posts. C ya :)&lt;/p&gt;
