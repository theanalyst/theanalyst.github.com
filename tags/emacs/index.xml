      <description>My friend, Jinto, wrote a blog-post titled Transitioning from learners to observers, which talks about the increasing transition from a learner to being a casual observer of things in this digital era. The availability of a wide range of tools these days to do almost anything, has slowly reduced the need to learn, a very valid observation.
While the usefulness of tools is great, it might fail miserably when you want things certain way, and the tool may not be designed for that.</description>

      <description>This post lists the details of my blog, which is powered by gh-pages and pelican. In short another guy puts up his blog at GitHub and blogs about it. It initially started as a Lorem Ipsum content while I was testing out my rough and edgy pelican theme. You have been warned!
Welcome to the new avatar of my blog which is powered by pelican, just another static site generator.</description>
