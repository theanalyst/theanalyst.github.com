<p>This post lists the details of my blog, which is powered by gh-pages
and pelican. In short another guy puts up his blog at GitHub and blogs
about it. It initially started as a Lorem Ipsum content while I was
testing out my rough and edgy pelican theme. You have been warned!</p>

<p>Welcome to the new avatar of my blog which is powered by <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.0/" title="pelican">pelican</a>,
just another static site generator. For the uninitiated, static sites
are just a bunch of html pages, reminiscent of those old times where
people used some ftp program to put some html pages in some server
space. Remember the saying, “the more things change, the more they
remain the same.” It is a full circle from plain html -&gt; dynamic
content based websites -&gt; Back to plain html again. Well static site
generators do just that, convert your favorite markup format into
something a webserver can serve.</p>

<p>Also static site generators are dime a dozen, these days, you will
always get one matching the language of your choice and markup of your
choice as well. (Psst. if you are interested, I have tried making a
sentence with a few If you are the type who hates wordplay, skip right
ahead, there is nothing here… <sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:wordplay"><a href="#fn:wordplay">1</a></sup>).</p>

<p>At the moment Jekyll <em>arguably</em> leads the pack<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:lists"><a href="#fn:lists">2</a></sup>,
with close to ~8.2K watchers in Github, while that metric doesn’t
actually tell the number of sites actually built using Jekyll. FYI,
almost any post on jekyll trends in Hacker News, and even the US
election campaign has used Jekyll for blogging. A more
interesting information would be just googling Jekyll, about <sup>4</sup>&frasl;<sub>10</sub>
links in the first page go to <em>Jekyll</em> the static site generator, the
rest mostly links to Jekyll the TV show, and none link to <em>Jekyll and
Hyde</em>, the novella (condolences to R L Stevenson). This is similar to
googling “Big Bang Theory”, TV has a higher preference than cosmology,
of course.<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:Googling-the-Big-Bang-theory-will-have-actually-no-first-page-results-on-cosmology-at-all"><a href="#fn:Googling-the-Big-Bang-theory-will-have-actually-no-first-page-results-on-cosmology-at-all">0</a></sup></p>

<p>Now talking that much on jekyll, this site isn&rsquo;t generated via Jekyll,
it is generated by Pelican, a static generator written in python. And
this was the primary reason, just that in case things need to work in
a certain way, it could be done without setting my hair on fire.
Though knowledge of python isn&rsquo;t an absolute necessity if your
intention is just to create a site in pelican, but recommended. Like
other well known static site generators, pelican also features these
(last point is a bit debatable):</p>

<ul>
<li>Good Documentation</li>
<li>Easy templating system</li>
<li>Good community support</li>
<li>Written in python</li>
</ul>

<p>Posts are written in markdown, in emacs. A simple git repository with
post commit hooks that runs pelican on each commit, does the trick of
generating the html pages. The config file is a simple python file
which takes care of all the site related details, links etc.</p>

<p>Pelican comes with a default set of themes, and a few others available
at the <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes">pelican-themes</a> repo, which can help in setting up a blog
running without much hassle. Building a theme is also pretty easy, and
it uses Jinja templating in the backend, this blog look right now is a
customised theme built upon the existing tuxlite-tbs theme, I will
write on that another time. (This post is already long enough as it
is)</p>

<p>For the typographically conscious, there is support from the excellent
emacs <a href="https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/typoel" title="Typographical Punctuation marks">typo</a> mode which takes care of your punctuation marks, if
you are the type who cares about the <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/08/15/mind-your-en-and-em-dashes-typographic-etiquette/" title="Mind your em and en dashes">em &amp; en–dashes</a>. (Yes, we
have a mode for everything… including a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA" title="Eliza, the quintessential psychotherapist">psychotherapist</a>, who can
kill time, if not depression) That is pretty much it, as far as
generating a site in pelican is concerned, simple.</p>

<h3 id="foot-notes">Foot Notes</h3>

<p>popularity, its precedence in search results…
possibilities out there, generating a static site is as easy as baking
a <a href="https://bolt80.com/piecrust" title="PieCrust">piecrust</a>. You just have to <a href="https://github.com/schrockwell/chisel" title="Chisel">chisel</a> your heart&rsquo;s content in
the markup format of your choice and hire a <a href="http://middlemanapp.com" title="Middle Man">middleman</a> to solve
the strange case of Dr.<a href="http://jekyllrb.com" title="jekyll">Jekyll</a> and Mr.<a href="http://ringce.com/hyde" title="hyde, Jekyll’s evil alter-ego in python ">Hyde</a>, whose obsession
with <a href="http://octopress.org" title="Octopress, pressing content for hackers">Octopress</a>, is <a href="https://github.com/blahed/frank" title="Frank">frank</a>ly <a href="https://github.com/caolan/petrify" title="Petrify">petrify</a>ing. (This is far
from the list of possibilities, but it is difficult, though, to make a
valid English sentence with all the static site generators out
there. A relatively comprehensive list is at <a href="http://nanoc.stoneship.org" title="nanoc">nanoc</a> which, FYI, is
also another static site generator.  Choose your poison)</p>
