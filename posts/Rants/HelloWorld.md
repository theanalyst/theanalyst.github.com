Title: Hello World
Tags: Rants
Category: Rants

If you're reading this, it means that I have successfully started
blogging again. As the more perceptive of you might have
realized, this blog isn't hosted at *blogger* anymore well this new
avatar is powered by [pelican](pelican.notmyidea.org), an awesome
static blogging engine written in python and served by github pages,
(of course the second part should be intuitionally obvious, given the
url atm). 

While the sabbatical from *blogosphere* has been long, it was more
because of lack of anything to post rather than too busy to post
anything, and now I'm back from a questionably long self-imposed
exile. And life has been relatively smooth in the interlude,(though my
last post was from college, which I dearly miss now) and I'm a
graduand now with a job going along just fine and learning new things
in the process.

While I'm still in the process of importing previous posts and
comments from blogger (read I am yet to decide whether the pain is
worth it or not), you should have fun reading the blog with its
current content which should be narcissistic links to me-pages. You
should be seeing proper posts being pushed into this url soon.

If you have read upto this point, I would urge you to take the leap of
faith, and follow my alter-egos in the parallel universes of
*twitterati* and *blogosphere*.
