It has been a significant time between the posts. This time the reason
moslty being me lazy enough not to fix the blog after a pelican
update. Surpisingly though there wasn't much of a change required
other than tweaking a couple of configuration variables & renaming the
`pelicanconf` file. Hope to start blogging again soon. This time for
real and hopefully more tech posts. C ya :)
