This is the quintessential “I'm back” post in blogosphere, which is
often marked by a blogger coming up with *imaginative* reasons
to explain a questionable absence from the virtual world. 
Tempting explanations for, not writing for so long, include 
work pressure, often marked by people blaming work for
(not) following their interests, a generic term, which, writers & artists
lovingly call the writer’s block, to describe their shortage of
creativity. Of course, if you know me, you know the actual reason is
just a cover up for not mentioning my often recurring theme of
procrastination. This time though twitcrastination[^twit] is to blame
for most of it.

Of late, I have found a new obsession for (micro) blogging in form of
twitter, a service, which apparently,<s> lets you post links to
instagram dinner pics</s>, helps people to connect to people and
organisations they care about. However, what happens in reality is
explained in part by the graph below.(A certain Gauss must be
twisting & turning in his grave here, for the blatant abuse of normal
distributions that is about to follow [^xkcd]):

Seeing the world's desire to shorten its verbosity, and the disturbing
increase in TL;DR statuses, I am thinking of killling my blog to 
embrace the merry little challenges of microblogging. 
Why should anything stand the test of time and be etched in stone?
Its 2013, ephemeral (like twitter statuses) is the way to go for your thoughts and actions


[^twit]: Procrastination enabled by use of twitter, a term which the 
twitterati obsessively uses to explain their apparent lack of productivity

stats, XKCDify any matplotlib graph; details [here][1] and source [here][3]
