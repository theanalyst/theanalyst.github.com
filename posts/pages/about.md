First release in '89, infinitely beta thereafter, geek, foss
enthusiast, enjoying life at the moment

Hello there, I'm Abhishek, an electrical engineer from National
Institute of Technology, Calicut. Now if you really want to know about
me professionally you should check out something like my linkedin
page, this space is mostly, well about *nothing* in particular (watch
for changes in this part as the blog evolves). When Jerry Seinfeld
created Seinfeld it was a show about well, nothing, but just small
amusing things that happen in everyday life. While I'm no raconteur to
narrate everyday things in an interesting way, I'll try my best. I
love XKCD (the ones with word-play in particular), music and reading
among other things. Though reading is something I'm trying to catch up
at present.

So while you are reading the blog of the greatest programmer, I should
tell that brickbats, comments and suggestions are most welcome 

If you want to take the leap of faith, and follow my alter-egos in the
parallel universes of *twitterati* and *blogosphere*.

P.S *theanalyst* is an anagram for 'A shy talent' back when I started
blogging I felt it was oddly appropriate
