First release in '89, infinitely beta thereafter, geek, foss
enthusiast, enjoying life at the moment

Hello there, I'm Abhishek, an electrical engineer from National
Institute of Technology, Calicut. This little space is mostly, about
*nothing* in particular (watch for changes in this part as the blog
evolves). When Jerry Seinfeld created Seinfeld it was a show about
well, nothing, but just small amusing things that happen in everyday
life. While I'm no raconteur to narrate everyday things in an
interesting way, I'll try my best. I love XKCD, music and reading
among other things. Though reading is something I'm trying to catch up
at present.

So while you are reading the blog of the greatest programmer, I should
tell that brickbats, comments and suggestions are most welcome.

P.S *theanalyst* is an anagram for 'A shy talent' back when I started
blogging I felt it was oddly appropriate
