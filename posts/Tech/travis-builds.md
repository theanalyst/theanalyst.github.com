Lately, travis CI has started supporting builds using [container][1]
based infrastructure which run much faster due to more available
resources and good use of caching. This is currently possible only for
projects that don't use `sudo` atm . For more details read [this][2]
post. Of late, I have been submitting Pull Requests to various
projects to use this feature wherever possible. This post is primarily
oriented towards Python projects.

For many python projects, a significant amount of time is spent in
installing & building the dependencies. So caching these should save
you a good amount of time. Pip downloads can be cached specifying a
cache directory, which will avoid hitting the pypi mirror for every
line in your requirements. The below examples assume that your testing
script is something like `make travis`

    :::yaml
	sudo : false
	cache:
	  directories: 
        - $HOME/.pip-cache
	script:
	  - pip install -r requirements.txt --download-cache $HOME/.pip-cache	
	  - make travis


The above lines will make sure that for subsequent runs pip packages
from the cache are used. However the packages will still need to be be
built, which means if you're using packages using C (lxml for eg), a
lot of time will be still spent for building the package itself. One
way of working around this would be the use of Python Wheels and
caching them as this avoids the need for subsequent builds. We could
download the wheels to a specified directory and cache that, so that
we can cut down on the build time.  So we would have something like:

    :::yaml
	sudo : false
	cache:
	  directories: 
        - $PWD/wheelhouse
	script:
	  - pip wheel -r requirements.txt
	  - pip install -r requirements.txt
	  - make travis


And voila! We have faster travis builds.

PS If you have better ways to speedup, I'll be happy to hear, please
let me know in comments or hit me up on [twitter][3].
