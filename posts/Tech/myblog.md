Summary: This is the details of my blog, which is powered by Github-pages & pelican. In short another guy puts up his blog at gh-pages and blogs about it. It started as a Lorem Ipsum content to fill something to test my Pelican site, and just another rant on static generators in general. Also delivers the same kind of workflow/dotfiles voyeurism that is expected in this kind of a post. A hyperbolic description of the state of static generators follows. You have been warned before clicking the read more button …

This post lists the details of my blog, which is powered by gh-pages
and pelican. In short another guy puts up his blog at GitHub and blogs
about it. It initially started as a Lorem Ipsum content while I was
testing out my rough and edgy pelican theme. You have been warned!

Welcome to the new avatar of my blog which is powered by [pelican][1],
just another static site generator. For the uninitiated, static sites
are just a bunch of html pages, reminiscent of those old times where
people used some ftp program to put some html pages in some server
space. Remember the saying, “the more things change, the more they
remain the same.” It is a full circle from plain html -> dynamic
content based websites -> Back to plain html again. Well static site
generators do just that, convert your favorite markup format into
something a webserver can serve.
    
Also static site generators are dime a dozen, these days, you will
always get one matching the language of your choice and markup of your
choice as well. (Psst. if you are interested, I have tried making a
sentence with a few If you are the type who hates wordplay, skip right
ahead, there is nothing here… [^wordplay]). 

At the moment Jekyll *arguably* leads the pack[^lists],
with close to ~8.2K watchers in Github, while that metric doesn’t
actually tell the number of sites actually built using Jekyll. FYI,
almost any post on jekyll trends in Hacker News, and even the US
election campaign has used Jekyll for blogging. A more
interesting information would be just googling Jekyll, about 4/10
links in the first page go to *Jekyll* the static site generator, the
rest mostly links to Jekyll the TV show, and none link to *Jekyll and
Hyde*, the novella (condolences to R L Stevenson). This is similar to
googling “Big Bang Theory”, TV has a higher preference than cosmology,
of course.[^tweet] (Googling “*the* Big Bang theory” will have
actually no first page results on cosmology at all…)

Now talking that much on jekyll, this site isn't generated via Jekyll,
it is generated by Pelican, a static generator written in python. And
this was the primary reason, just that in case things need to work in
a certain way, it could be done without setting my hair on fire.
Though knowledge of python isn't an absolute necessity if your
intention is just to create a site in pelican, but recommended. Like
other well known static site generators, pelican also features these
(last point is a bit debatable):

 - Good Documentation
 - Easy templating system
 - Good community support
 - Written in python

Posts are written in markdown, in emacs. A simple git repository with
post commit hooks that runs pelican on each commit, does the trick of
generating the html pages. The config file is a simple python file
which takes care of all the site related details, links etc.

Pelican comes with a default set of themes, and a few others available
at the [pelican-themes][18] repo, which can help in setting up a blog
running without much hassle. Building a theme is also pretty easy, and
it uses Jinja templating in the backend, this blog look right now is a
customised theme built upon the existing tuxlite-tbs theme, I will
write on that another time. (This post is already long enough as it
is)

For the typographically conscious, there is support from the excellent
emacs [typo][12] mode which takes care of your punctuation marks, if
you are the type who cares about the [em & en–dashes][13]. (Yes, we
have a mode for everything… including a [psychotherapist][17], who can
kill time, if not depression) That is pretty much it, as far as
generating a site in pelican is concerned, simple.




### Foot Notes
[^lists]: For more info on this read,a [crowdsourced list][15] and a [HN poll][16] for static generators 
[^tweet]: This [tweet][14], sums up the The Big Bang Theory
popularity, its precedence in search results…

[^wordplay]: These days, one is [awestruc][8] with the number of
possibilities out there, generating a static site is as easy as baking
a [piecrust][11]. You just have to [chisel][6] your heart's content in
the markup format of your choice and hire a [middleman][5] to solve
the strange case of Dr.[Jekyll][2] and Mr.[Hyde][3], whose obsession
with [Octopress][4], is [frank][9]ly [petrify][10]ing. (This is far
from the list of possibilities, but it is difficult, though, to make a
valid English sentence with all the static site generators out
there. A relatively comprehensive list is at [nanoc][7] which, FYI, is
also another static site generator.  Choose your poison)
